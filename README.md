## Transferring Local Saves to Server
_read the fix_host_save_readme.txt for instructions and make sure to check the fix_host_save_screenshots for clear images on how to do the instructions properly_

## How to Automatically Delete Player Saves Based on Inactivity
1. Copy everything from your server (`\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\0\RANDOMSERVERID\`) into the same location within the tool (`PalworldSaveTools\`).
2. Run `fix_save.cmd`.
3. Run `sort_players.cmd` and/or `delete_pals_save.cmd`.
4. Copy the `Players` folder from the tool.
5. Delete the original `Players` folder from the server (`\Pal\Saved\SaveGames\0\RANDOMSERVERID\`).
6. Paste the copied `Players` folder into the server folder.
7. Profit?

## Additional Notes
- **Days:** Tracks players inactive for a specified number of days (e.g., 30 days and older).
- **Level:** Tracks players up to a specified level (e.g., level 30 or lower).
- **Pals:** Deletes players based on the number of pals (e.g., 10 or fewer pals).
- The fixed save (`PalworldSaveTools\fixed\Level.sav`) is no longer functional after patch v0.3+.
- As of update v0.5.5, you can view the total number of pals caught/owned. To do so, copy the server's `Players` folder into the tool's `Players` folder.
